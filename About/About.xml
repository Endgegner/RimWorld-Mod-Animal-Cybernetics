  <description>&lt;color=#c970db&gt;&lt;b&gt;Animal Health Care &amp; Prothestics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

This is a 6 kilobyte(!) blitz addon, which completely fills out all your needs on animal prothestics, with or without any other mod extension for that matter installed. Patches will only go off, when needed. While other mods add new items, this takes the vanilla Prothestics and treats them as both for animals and pawns. 

Allows the installation of vanilla cybernetics on animals and makes specialized but loaded mods like 'A Dog Said' unnecessary. You may still keep and add such addons for specialized items, they won't interfere at all. 

[FSF] VBE and EPOE are supported. Rare Archotech is excluded (in most cases).

&lt;i&gt;You want a hydraulic jaw on your Warg? Well, me too.&lt;/i&gt; This mod makes that possible.

Based on Lulu's Animal Cybernetics, which dissappeared from the Workshop for some reason. I really loved it and wanted to bring it back to the family with this enhanced version. Hope you enjoy.
